# Restart VM from button

Simple script on how to restart a VM hosted in Synology using a button connected to a Raspberry PI

Background: After change back to winter time in 2021, Home Assistant VM went nuts and the only solution was to restart the Virtual Machine where it's running. Since the rest of the family lacks the technological background to do so, they were stuck till I was available to make the restart. This kept me thinking, and after a nice discussion in the Facebook group of Home Assistant, a few nice suggestions ended up in this script.

This scripts allows by pressing a physical button to restart a Virtual Machine hosted in a Synology environment. Synology provides an API for controlling remotely the virtual machine environement, documented here:
